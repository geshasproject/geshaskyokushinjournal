				<p class="center">Hi There,</p>
				<p> I am a rookie in Web Development and versed in Kyokushin Karate, Boxing and Soccer. I strive to become a Front-End Developer expert.
				When I have free time, I enjoy listening to music (rock, metal, jazz, blues and African rhythms), reading books, watching movies, learning logo design, branding, playing on Jembe, darbuka. Of course, I love spending the time with my three kids.
